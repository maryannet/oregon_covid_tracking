# Oregon COVID Tracking

To start, this is a simple analysis notebook and some data sets.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages in the [requirements file](requirements.txt).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## The data

### `data/input/`

Local files corresponding to data I retrieved from other sources. You can see more information on this by viewing the notebook in your browser.

I'll add better descriptions here soon.

### `data/output/`

Data after normalization, merging and modest calculation.

I'll add better descriptions here soon too.
